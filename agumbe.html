     <h3 style="margin-left: 30px;">AGUMBE</h3>
     <p style="margin-left: 30px;">Agumbe is peaceful , a small village in the mountains and it becomes even more stunning than usual during the monsoon, the best time to visit Agumbe, the only sad fact that you won’t be able to visit the waterfalls. It will be closed but that won’t make you feel bad I gu. You can definitely ditch waterfalls for such a wonderful rain experience.
        Monsoon was at its peak when I visited Agumbe. The rain didn’t stop from the time I reached there  on a saturday morning. Agumbe was sleeping tight under the blanket of fog. The rain was not heavy, mostly drizzle. It feels like the rain is behind you, watching,  wherever you go here.  It was a chill feel all over.
        Spotted a big house on roadside itself, right guess, it was the well known Doddamane. I had read about the Doddamane in most stories of those who visited Agumbe. Wished to stay there but couldn’t get a room since we did not call them in advance. Doddamane is an old house, it was the only option for accomodation there before the other hotels and guest houses. There was a television series telecated in Indian national channel, based on the book “ Malgudi days” by R.K Narayan. The Doddamane was a one of the main character in that series. It is managed by Kasturi akka and her son now. Most of those who travel to Agumbe prefer to stay in Doddamane.
