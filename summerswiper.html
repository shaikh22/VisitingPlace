   <h3>MANALI</h3>
 <p>If it is summer in India, you cannot find a destination more aptly suitable for a vacation than Manali. If the picturesque views are the highlight of the region, the adventure sports in the area make it irresistible. But the list of attractions does not end here, the religious touch of the place with its temples and monasteries is a further mystifying feature of this place. The nearby Solang Valley and Rohtang Pass are some of the distinguished places one can visit while vacationing here.</p>

  <h3>SHIMLA</h3>
<p>Shimla is an ideal destination to spend your summer holiday in India. It offers one of those home away from home experiences and draws attention of families who are looking for a comfortable, leisurely stay amidst picturesque surroundings. The reason I would pick Shimla as a family holiday destination is the fact that the climate is bearable in summers (neither too hot nor too cold), there are several avenues for dining (all cuisine are available), plentiful shopping and accommodation options, and the low-traffic.</p>
